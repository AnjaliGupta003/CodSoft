Task 3: Password Generator
Overview
This folder contains the implementation of a password generator application. The tool generates strong and random passwords based on user-specified length and complexity. Users can specify the length of the password and choose from various complexity levels to ensure the generated password meets their security needs.

Objective
The goal of this task is to develop a Python application that generates random passwords. The application should:

Allow users to specify the length of the password.
Provide options for different levels of complexity, including:
Simple (Lowercase letters only)
Medium (Lowercase and Uppercase letters)
Strong (Lowercase, Uppercase, and Digits)
Very Strong (Lowercase, Uppercase, Digits, and Special Characters)
Project Structure
Task3/: The main directory for Task 3.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
password_generator.py: The Python script that contains the logic for generating passwords.
Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used to develop the password generator.
Setup and Usage
Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the Task3 directory:

cd CODSOFT/Task3
Run the Password Generator application:

python password_generator.py
Usage Instructions:

When prompted, enter the desired length of the password.
Choose the complexity level from the following options:
1: Simple (Lowercase letters only)
2: Medium (Lowercase and Uppercase letters)
3: Strong (Lowercase, Uppercase, and Digits)
4: Very Strong (Lowercase, Uppercase, Digits, and Special Characters)
The generated password will be displayed on the screen.
Outcomes
Developed a password generator application that produces strong and random passwords.
Implemented different complexity levels to accommodate various security requirements.
