Task 1: To-Do List Application
Overview
This folder contains the implementation of a simple To-Do List application. The project helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently through a command-line or GUI-based interface.

Objective
The goal of this task is to develop a To-Do List application using Python that allows users to create, update, and track their tasks. This project serves as a practical example of managing tasks and using basic Python programming skills.

Project Structure
Task1/: The main directory for the To-Do List application.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
todo.py: The main Python script that contains the logic for the To-Do List application.
requirements.txt: (Optional) List of dependencies if any libraries are used.
data/: (Optional) A folder to store task data if needed, e.g., a JSON file to save tasks.
Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used to develop the To-Do List application.
Setup and Usage
Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the Task1 directory:

cd CODSOFT/Task1
Install dependencies (if any):

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the To-Do List application:

python todo.py
Usage Instructions:

The application allows users to:
Add tasks: Enter a task that needs to be completed.
View tasks: See a list of all the tasks.
Update tasks: Mark tasks as completed or update their details.
Delete tasks: Remove tasks from the list when they're no longer needed.
Outcomes
Created a basic To-Do List application that helps users manage their daily tasks.
Implemented features such as adding, updating, and deleting tasks.
