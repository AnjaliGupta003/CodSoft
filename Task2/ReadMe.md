Task 2: Simple Calculator
Overview
This folder contains the implementation of a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations and includes an exit option. The calculator allows users to input two numbers and choose an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). Users can also exit the application at any time.

Objective
The goal of this task is to create a simple command-line calculator application using Python. The application should:

Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Provide an option to exit the application gracefully.
Project Structure
Task2/: The main directory for Task 2.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
calculator_with_exit.py: The Python script that contains the logic for the calculator application.
Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used to develop the calculator application.
Setup and Usage
Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the Task2 directory:

cd CODSOFT/Task2
Run the Calculator application:

python calculator_with_exit.py
Usage Instructions:

When prompted, enter the first number and the second number.
Choose an operation from the following options:
1: Addition
2: Subtraction
3: Multiplication
4: Division
5: Exit
The result of the selected operation will be displayed.
If you choose to exit (option 5), the application will terminate gracefully.
Outcomes
Developed a command-line calculator with functionalities for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Added an exit option to allow users to terminate the application when desired.
Implemented basic error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.
